Introduction

This project is developed as part of my 4-month Internship Studio Training & Internship Program (July – October).
The goal of this internship is to gain in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning concepts, apply them to real-world datasets, and build end-to-end ML models that demonstrate practical skills.

The program combines structured training, guided assignments, and independent project work to ensure both learning and hands-on implementation.

📅 Internship Timeline

July (Month 1): Training on Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning basics

August (Month 2): Advanced Machine Learning algorithms & project selection

September (Month 3): Implementation of the internship project (model development, testing & evaluation)

October (Month 4): Final project completion, documentation, and submission
